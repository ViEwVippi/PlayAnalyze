But baby, men just don’t like carrying that junk through 
the store. You know Leroy don’t you? 
 
    PATRICIA 
Yeah 
 
    JOHN 
Well, his wife must have hypnotized him into buying those 
products and Tyrone saw him and the fellas ribbed him till 
him was near bout in tears.  
 
    PATRICIA 
That’s ridiculous and it’s childish. Wait a minute, you 
told me that you had to pick them up for your mother. 
 
    JOHN 
Yeah, I did. And you know what that big purple box with the 

white flower did for my social life? Girls wouldn’t even 
look my way. 
 
    PATRICIA 
Well, did you explain that to your mother? 
 
    JOHN 
Explain? I protested. 
 
    PATRICIA 
 So she let you off the hook?  
 
    JOHN 
Let me off the hook? Are you kiddin?. Momma gave me a right 
hook to the top of my head. You know that scar where hair 
won’t grow? 
 
   
Yes. 
 
    JOHN 
That was the result of my protest.  
 
    PATRICIA 
I don’t see what the problem is. Besides women do it all 
the time. 
    JOHN 
That’s because you women need those products all the time 
 
    PATRICIA 
No, that’s not what I mean. I mean women buy men’s 
underwear, men’s funky foot spray and men’s jock itch cream 
all the time and no problem. Who cares what anyone thinks? 
 
    JOHN 
Yeah because you women want to be a man’s everything all 
the time, our doctor, our lawyer, our dentist, our 
urologist, our proctologist, dermatologist, our 
cardiologist our 
    PATRICIA 
Okay Okay I get your point. 
 
    JOHN 
I don’t think you do Trish, see you creatures 
 
    PATRICIA 
Creatures? 

 
    JOHN 
Yes, you creatures are just some busy thinking all day and 
thinking all night creatures. Why ya’ll think all the time?  
 
    PATRICIA 
I’m not sure why one of us needs to do that but, I think 
you’re busy making no sense all day and like I said a real 
man wouldn’t mind one bit 
 
    JOHN 
Well and like I said while I’m out I’ll find a real man for 
you you know that guy with the glasses resting on the tip 
of his nose oh and I believe his name is Mr. Pecked, first 
name Hen
